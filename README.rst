Documentation specification
---------------------------

The documentation is:

- Written in `RST markup <https://docutils.sourceforge.io/docs/user/rst/quickref.html>`_
- Generated using `Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/>`_
- Hosted on `ReadTheDocs <https://readthedocs.org/>`_

How to start
------------

Prepare the infrastructure
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
| To start working on this documentation you will have to install required components.
  It's well described in `ReadTheDocs documentation <https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/intro/getting-started-with-sphinx.html>`_.
| However, here's a quick list of what needs to be done:

* Install `Python <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`_

    .. note::
        In the Python installation wizard check the "Add Python to environment variables" option

* Install `Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/>`_

    .. code-block:: py

        pip install sphinx

Prepare your environment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We find the `Visual Studio Code <https://code.visualstudio.com/>`_ to be a great IDE to work on this documentation and we configure some automation for it.
Since it's written in **RST** markup, we recommend to install `RST Preview <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tht13.rst-vscode>`_ extension
to highlight the syntax. It also allows you to immediately preview the document in the IDE using ``ctrl+shiht+v`` combination or ``ctrl+k v`` to  open preview to the side.

Regardles of IDE used, please do following:

#. Clone the repository
#. Install all required dependencies from ``\docs\requirements.txt`` file.

    .. code-block:: py

        pip install -r requirements.txt


Build and test
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

| Once you install all the required components, setup the environment and clone the repo, you're ready to make some changes.
  As it was mentioned earlier you can preview your changes in the IDE. However, to get the full documentaion running locally, you'll have to generate it.

To build the documentation:

#. If you use `Visual Studio Code` run the build task (`ctrl+shiht+b`)
#. OR if you use terminal then go to ``docs`` directory and executing this command

    .. code-block:: py

        .\make.bat html

#. After a while you should get the ``_build`` folder created where you can find there ``html`` catalog with ``index.html`` file inside. Open it.

| Sometimes you may notice that after building, the files won't get updated.
  In such case we recommand to run ``make clean`` command or just remove ``_build`` catalog and try again.

Pushing changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Please make your changes in feature branches starting from master branch, using naming convention presented below:

* use only lower case
* do not use whitespaces
* do not use any special characters except: -/
* `feature/[feature-description]` - to implement new features, eg. `feature/authenticate-module`
* `fix/[bug-description]` - to fix bugs, eg. `bug/incorect-link`

Once the changes are done and tested you are ready to create a pull request.
