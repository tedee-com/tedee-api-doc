How to manage and operate gates
================================

In this tutorial, we will go through gate management. We will show you how to manage gates and how to operate them.

.. note::

    You need to remember that the gate is an external device. To add gates to your Tedee account, you first need to set up an integration to BleBox using the Tedee mobile app. Once you are linked with BleBox, your BleBox devices should be synced with the Tedee account.


Get user gates
---------------------

To get list of user gates use :doc:`Get all <../endpoints/gate/get-all>` endpoint:

**Sample request**

.. code-block:: sh

    curl -X GET "|apiUrl|/api/|apiVersion|/my/gate" -H "accept: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer <<access token>>"

As a result, you will get a list of gates you have synchronized between Tedee and BleBox accounts. You will see the last sync state between Tedee and BleBox systems using the GET endpoint. In the following paragraphs, we will present how to sync the gates state to the latest one.

The GET endpoint can check the current gate connection status, firmware, and impulse length, which is the gate opening signal duration.

.. note::
    You must use the Blebox (wBox app) directly to update impulse length or gate firmware.

The important thing is to understand states gate can have:

    1. **connected** - The gate is connected to BleBox. The open operations can be performed (IsConnected is true, and IsPresentInExternal is true).
    
    2. **disconnected** - The gate is disconnected from the network connection but still exists in BleBox. The open operation can fail if the connection is not re-established in the meantime (IsConnected is false, and IsPresentInExternal is true).
    
    3. **unlinked** - Gate is not present in the user BleBox account but still exists in Tedee. (IsPresentInExternal is false).

Get gate by id
---------------------

To get single gate by id use :doc:`Get single <../endpoints/gate/get-single>` endpoint:

**Sample request**

.. code-block:: sh

    curl -X GET "|apiUrl|/api/|apiVersion|/my/gate/1" -H "accept: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer <<access token>>"

As a result you will get single gate with same details as described above.

Delete gate 
---------------------

To delete gate use :doc:`Get single <../endpoints/gate/delete>` endpoint:

**Sample request**

.. code-block:: sh

    curl -X DELETE "|apiUrl|/api/|apiVersion|/my/gate/1" -H "accept: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer <<access token>>"

After running this endpoint, the gate will disappear from your Tedee account.

.. warning::

    The gate will be added as a new device during the next synchronization between the Tedee and Blebox systems. If you want to delete the gate permanently, you must delete it from your BleBox account first.


Sync
---------------------

Synchronization is a process of updating gates data in Tedee with data from BleBox. It is required to have current data from BleBox in Tedee.

.. note::
    Synchronization is a one-way process. Tedee will not update BleBox data.


.. note::
    Gates that are present in Tedee and are not present in BleBox will be marked as unlinked. When an unlinked gate appears in BleBox again, it will be linked.

The synchronization process is performed by Tedee automatically 24 hours after the last successful full synchronization. You can also trigger it manually using the following endpoints.

Sync user gates
---------------------

To sync gates from linked BleBox account use :doc:`Sync all <../endpoints/gate/sync-all>` endpoint:

**Sample request**

.. code-block:: sh

    curl -X POST "|apiUrl|/api/|apiVersion|/my/gate/sync" -H "accept: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer <<access token>>"

As a result, your gates data from BleBox is synchronized to Tedee.

Sync single gate
---------------------

To sync single gate use :doc:`Sync single <../endpoints/gate/sync-single>` endpoint:

**Sample request**

.. code-block:: sh

    curl -X POST "|apiUrl|/api/|apiVersion|/my/gate/1/sync" -H "accept: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer <<access token>>"

As a result, you will sync only a single gate with the logic described above. Sync single does not delay auto-sync as it does not affect other gates.
