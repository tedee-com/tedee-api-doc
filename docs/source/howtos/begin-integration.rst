How to begin integration
========================

All the endpoints exposed on this API require authentication.
You can find a guide to achieve that on :doc:`../howtos/authenticate` page.

.. _get-client-id:

Client id for you application
-----------------------------

If you want to use Code Flow or Implicit Flow in the authorization process, you will need a **client id** issued for your application by Tedee. 
For that please send the request for obtaining **client id** using this `form <https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=ibO271oOn0SweG6SXqsY5mzyA4EPEdlFuUag8sIe36JUNUU4VExYVksxTlU5WDRKUFNHTFdZT0Q3Ni4u>`_.

Based on above information, we will register your application in our system and send you **client id** and **client secret**.

**More information**

If you need more information about integration please check following links:

* check already existing :doc:`Examples <example-integrations>`,
* if you need help then start discussion on the community `forum <https://tedee.freshdesk.com/en/support/discussions>`_,
* scopes that will be requested by your application during the authorization process (`list of available scopes <../howtos/authenticate.html#list-of-scopes>`_).
