How to begin integration
========================

All the endpoints exposed on this API require authentication.
You can find a guide to achieve that on :doc:`../howtos/authenticate` page.

.. _get-client-id:

Client id for you application
-----------------------------

If you want to use Code Flow or Implicit Flow in the authorization process, you will need a **client id** issued for your application by Tedee. 
For that please send the request for obtaining **client id** using this `form <https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=ibO271oOn0SweG6SXqsY5mzyA4EPEdlFuUag8sIe36JUNUU4VExYVksxTlU5WDRKUFNHTFdZT0Q3Ni4u>`_.

Based on above information, we will register your application in our system and send you **client id** and **client secret**.
