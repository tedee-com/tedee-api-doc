How to begin integration
========================

All the endpoints exposed on this API require authentication.
You can find a guide to achieve that on :doc:`../howtos/authenticate` page.

.. _get-client-id:

Client id for you application
-----------------------------

If you want to use Code Flow or Implicit Flow in the authorization process, you will need a **client id** issued for your application by Tedee.
Please contact us (support@tedee.com) to receive a **client id** and **client secret** for your application. 
Please provide the following information in your message:

* name of your company / application
* general description of your application
* scenarios in which your application will be used
* operations that will be performed in the Tedee API by your application
* scopes that will be requested by your application during the authorization process (`list of available scopes <../authentication.html#list-of-scopes>`_)
* which authorization flow you want to use in your application
* the redirect URI of your application, where authentication responses are sent and received by your application 
* e-mail address of the person responsible for integration

Based on above information, we will register your application in our system and send you **client id** and **client secret**.

Safe areas
^^^^^^^^^^

The protective field defines the minimal area around the logo, where no other text or graphic may appear. The protective field is based on the height of the sign.
